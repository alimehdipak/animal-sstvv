<p>You’ve probably seen a lot of emergency services for people, but you’ve probably never seen an animal being rescued, and this man also couldn’t believe he gave CPR to an elephant.<br />
<strong>That is so wonderful to know and so pleased that baby Ellie was saved. Thank you so much for what you did!</strong></p>
<p>A motorbike [stru.ck] a baby elephant as it crossed a road with a herd of wild elephants in Chanthaburi province, eastern Thailand. Mana Srivate, a local lifeguard, rushed to the scene as soon as people called for assistance.</p>
<p>He is perplexed that his first aid subject is an elephant; in his 26-year career, he has performed dozens of CPR, but never on an elephant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3">
<div id="M822805ScriptRootC1344714_0a4fd">
<div id="MarketGidComposite1344714_0a4fd"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3906" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_23-300x225-2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was, however, professional and quick to tre.at the strangest pa.tient he had ever encountered. It was instinct, but I was nervous the whole time because I could hear the mother and other elephants calling her baby.</p>
<p>Srivate attempted to give the po.or creature a heart massage while colleagues a few meters away tre.ated the motorcyclist and were left stu.nned. Srivate doesn’t even know where the elephant’s heart is, so he relies on human theory and a video clip he saw online to save the baby elephant.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3909" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_29-1-300x225-2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>Not only that, but rescuers are under even more pressure because the rest of the elephants are not far away and could arrive at any time. The baby elephant miraculously revived after a dra.matic ten-minute period. Fortunately, the motorcyclist was not se.rio.usly hu.rt.</p>
<p>Srivate almost cri.ed when the baby elephant began to move. That is truly amazing!<br />
After 10 minutes, the elephant slowly stood up and was loaded onto a truck and transported to another location for tre.atment before being returned to the original location to be reunited with its herd.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3908" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_28-2-300x225-2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>This was the first time Mana provided first aid to an elephant, and he was overjoyed when the baby elephant was saved. Many people have admired his quick wits; we can’t imagine the disaster if Mana does not arrive on time.</p>
<p><strong>God bless Mana and the baby elephant!</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3904" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_27-300x225-2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>So happy this baby is alive. Good on you for doing that, very kind hearted person you are well done! Thank you for saving that sweet baby.<br />
GOD BLESS YOU BOTH! <img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f496.svg" alt="&#x1f496;" /><img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f64f.svg" alt="&#x1f64f;" /><img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f64f.svg" alt="&#x1f64f;" /><img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f64f.svg" alt="&#x1f64f;" /></p>

Bless You For Your Love &amp; Caring! <img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/2764.svg" alt="&#x2764;" /><img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/2764.svg" alt="&#x2764;" /><img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/2764.svg" alt="&#x2764;" /></p>

<p dir="ltr"> A dog that had been missing for two months was rescued by a team of speleologists. Due to the layout of the building, their objective was especially challenging, as reported by positive-info.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Almost two months after disappearing on June 9, a dog named Abby was discovered and saved by cave divers on August 6.</p>

<p dir="ltr">When hunting for Abby, how did her family not notice that she had wandered off and ended up in a cave? Only she can provide a definitive response to this inquiry. Even though she had access to water and freshwater fish and crustaceans, it is unknown how she survived in this unfriendly and entirely dark habitat.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3861" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3-80-238x300-1.png" alt="" width="238" height="300" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">However, experts immediately went into action to save the puppy after learning that she had been seen in the Tom Moore subterranean tunnels between Brewer and Perryville in Missouri. The crew of cavers included Rick Haley and Gerry Keene. They went straight into the 35 km long maze. They eventually tracked down the animal, but freeing it was no easy task.</p>
</div>
<div class="HTML">
<p dir="ltr">They squished Abby into a 60-centimeter opening, then climbed the rock face 150 meters upward to the surface.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3862" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/5-51-231x300-1.png" alt="" width="231" height="300" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Robert Cahoon, deputy chief of the Biehle fire brigade, helped them outside. Between the two of them, they canvassed the area looking for the dog’s owners. Once they found the correct address, they were able to enter. Abby’s owners, who had given up hope that they would ever see their dog alive again after so much time had passed since she had vanished, were shocked. Back at home, the dog is taking it easy as she recovers from her ordeal.</p>

<h1><strong>Elephants are very loving, family oriented, compassionate animals who feel deeply!</strong></h1>
<p><strong>They are so family oriented taking care of the little one who lo.st his Mother.</strong><br />
HOW PRECIOUS!! ANIMALS have more COMPASSION than most HUMANS! <img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f495.svg" alt="&#x1f495;" /><img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f495.svg" alt="&#x1f495;" /><img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f4a4.svg" alt="&#x1f4a4;" /><img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f418.svg" alt="&#x1f418;" /><img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f418.svg" alt="&#x1f418;" /><img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f418.svg" alt="&#x1f418;" /></p>
<p>Many people’s hearts were br.o.ken when the orp.haned baby elephants shared their gri.ef and comforted another baby elephant who has just [lo.st] his mother.<br />
The emotional moment occurred in 2018, when a crew from the “David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT)”, an elephant orp.hanage, was in the area on a routine patrol when they noticed the stranger sign. A young’s lone tracks in the sand along the Tiva River.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3">
<div id="M822805ScriptRootC1344714_08bca">
<div id="MarketGidComposite1344714_08bca"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3815" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_1-6-300x225-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They quickly discovered an [exh.aus.ted] baby elephant cr.ying for its mother. Unfortunately, his mother di.ed a long time ago, and he was rescued by these good people.</p>
<p>The orp.haned Mukkoka is a one-year-old elephant who was me.dically checked, properly fed with the orp.hanage’s miracle milk formula, and miraculously recovered within a few days.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3816" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_2-5-300x225-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>However, for an orp.haned elephant, life was nothing but difficult, so the volunteers decided to introduce Mukkoka to the new family. And the other elephants surrounded him with care and concern as soon as he met his new herd as if they could sense his sa.dness.</p>
<p>They enveloped him and led him out into the woods to meet the other of the herd. The other infants gave him a warm welcome, extending out their trunks to reassure and accept Mukkoka as a new member of the family.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3814" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/thumb-41-300x163.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="163" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/thumb-41-300x163.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/thumb-41.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>This image shows once again these creatures are special beyond human imagination. They have a great deal of compassion and empathy for others.</p>
<p>Mukkoka will most likely spend the next ten years in the care of the DSWT before being released back into the wild. Until then, he’ll heal and learn how to be an elephant, with help from his loving foster family every step of the way.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3812" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_4-3-300x225-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>The baby elephant is now a member of a new family, and it will never be left behind, that’s for sure!</p>
<p>So sorry about the baby who lo.st his mom <img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f972.svg" alt="&#x1f972;" /> but grateful for the other Elephants who gave him so much love<img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/2764.svg" alt="&#x2764;" /><img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f499.svg" alt="&#x1f499;" /><br />
The human race could and should learn what Empathy is from what these wonderful Noble Animals are !!</p>

<p>They are the most beautiful animals inside and out.<br />
<strong>Such gentle loving creatures! <img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f495.svg" alt="&#x1f495;" /><img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f418.svg" alt="&#x1f418;" /><img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f495.svg" alt="&#x1f495;" /></strong></p>

<p>This is the tale of an orphaned polar bear who was rescued from the verge of fatality by gold miners in the Arctic.</p>
<p>The cub was entrusted to fend for herself after her mommy passed away while on a remote Russian island, this triggered her to come close to the gold mine and beg to be fed.</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3">

<p>In spite of their being policies prohibiting the feeding of polar bears, the miners decided that saving her life was more crucial.</p>
<p>Therefore, they all cared for her throughout several months, unfortunately, though, this implied she became tamed like a dog.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3801" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2-345-1-164x300.jpeg" alt="" width="164" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2-345-1-164x300.jpeg 164w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2-345-1.jpeg 306w" sizes="(max-width: 164px) 100vw, 164px" /></figure>
<p>As she no relied on the miners for her food, the polar bear cub lost the capacity to hunt for itself.</p>
<p>In the footage below, you can see the cub climbing up a ladder prior to jumping to adoringly hug among the miners.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">
<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">https://youtu.be/-kL68wODVs0</div>
</figure>
<p>” The women cub invested numerous months living near to humans, as well as obtained so used to them that it behaved like a canine,” stated a neighborhood record.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the gold miners’ contract finished as well as they returned back to the mainland, but not before making certain the polar bear cub was looked after.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3802" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3-314-1-278x300.jpeg" alt="" width="278" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3-314-1-278x300.jpeg 278w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3-314-1.jpeg 634w" sizes="(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px" /></figure>
<p>Andrey Gorban, 56, supervisor of Royev Ruchei Zoo in Krasnoyarsk, who supervised of the rescue said: “The workers could just connect with us at the end of their work stint, as they had no communication web link at the base.”</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3803" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/4-282-1-277x300.jpeg" alt="" width="277" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/4-282-1-277x300.jpeg 277w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/4-282-1.jpeg 634w" sizes="(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px" /></figure>
<p>“We were informed that the men were leaving back to the landmass, and also the cub had stayed there alone.”</p>
<p>” Our only hope was that they left rather a large open rubbish site, so there was a possibility that the cub could feed off it for weeks.”</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3804" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/5-230-1-226x300.jpeg" alt="" width="226" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/5-230-1-226x300.jpeg 226w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/5-230-1.jpeg 634w" sizes="(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px" /></figure>
<p>With help from the Moscow Zoo, a mission was released to save the tame bear by taking it to the Moscow Zoo.</p>
<p>The bear was discovered on the miners’ website plainly pining for its missing pals and was required to the Zoo where a decision will certainly be made on where to residence it.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3805" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6-190-1-200x300.jpeg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6-190-1-200x300.jpeg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6-190-1.jpeg 306w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></figure>
