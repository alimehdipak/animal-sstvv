She was just waiting for someone to give her a chance.\u201d<\/b><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stray dogs are usually sad and scared and that they retreat when humans try to touch them, to realize their trust it takes a while . It\u2019s always said that cats choose their owners, but today\u2019s story shows that dogs choose the owners also.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<div class=\"code-block code-block-3\">\n<div id=\"M822805ScriptRootC1344714_0c51b\">\n<div id=\"MarketGidComposite1344714_0c51b\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4284\" src=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/2822905787797118273-300x157.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"157\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/2822905787797118273-300x157.jpg 300w, https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/2822905787797118273.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On a Friday night, while a lady named Jillian was taking the trash out, she noticed an animal that was hiding behind a bush, the animal was a sweet dog that was confused and scared. She wanted to run towards the animal but which may have scared the poor canine, so she began to approach him carefully, but the instant the dog feel someone getting near him he started running. Jillian wanted to point out the dog that she isn\u2019t getting to hurt him, so she began to make a conversation and surprisingly the dog stood there listening to her before it ran and disappeared. The woman spotted the dog again the subsequent day, but this point it looks as if the animal knew the lady was there to assist him.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4281\" src=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/A2-20-300x205-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"205\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wanting to meet up with to the dog, Jillian came up with an idea, it worked perfectly since it involved food. \u201cWhen I rotated to go back inside, I noticed she was following me at a distance,\u201d Jillian told The Dodo. \u201cThat was once I figured I could get her to trust me. I got a bowl of water and a few pet food and left them within the corner of my yard before walking a secure distance away.\u201d The dog ate all the food and began following Jillian while keeping a secure distance. The kind woman didn\u2019t know needless to say if the dog is going to be there subsequent day but just in case he did, her husband and she or he knew what to try to in order that they can all become friends. \u201cWe got some more pet food and left a trail for her to follow back to our yard, where I fed her again,\u201d she said. \u201cThis time, I sat on the brink of the food. I expected her to run away after she ate, but instead she stayed next to me and even started sniffing me!\u201d<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4280\" src=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/A3-13-289x300-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"289\" height=\"300\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cWhen I got up, she followed me all the way into my backyard and sat next to me,\u201d Jillian added. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a stray dog warm up to me like this. She was just expecting someone to offer her an opportunity .\u201d The final encounter made Jillian 100% sure that she wanted the dog to become a part of her family, they named her Luna and now she is a crucial member of the family. \u201cWe decided to stay here because we are softies who can\u2019t say no,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve also always loved pit bull mixes so I fell crazy with Luna directly .\u201d Looks like Luna loved her new family also and likes to learn how to be more socialized with humans. \u201cLuna seems to be really smart,\u201d Jillian said. \u201cShe learned her name in at some point and is already responding to some basic commands, albeit it had been clear that no-one had taught them to her before.\u201d<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4277\" src=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/A4-7-250x300-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"300\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Luna is that the neatest thing that happened to this family they\u2019re now sure that, they desire the dog has been a part of their lives forever. \u201cShe\u2019s still a touch scared, especially of loud noises like doors closing, but she is that the sweetest,\u201d Jillian said. \u201cShe likes to frolic with us within the backyard and to snuggle up and provides us kisses once we sit down.\u201d We hope the story of sweet Luna will inspire more people to adopt pets and provides them forever homes.
