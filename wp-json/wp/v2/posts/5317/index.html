He\u2019s an enormous snuggly bear, his name fits him perfect,\u201d posted Tommie Bear\u2019s new mom. In Houston, Texas, Tommie Bear simplylies on his bed and barely acknowledges anyone passing by his shelter cage. The broken-hearted dog was returned to Harris County Pets again after just a couple of months.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tommie Bear came into the shelter as a stray in June 2020; he had a microchip and stayed on a contact owner hold for 6 days. Two people wanted to adopt him, and then the dog\u2019s first new human sent him to a different home who either allowed the dog to run loose or dumped him at the shelter again. And so four months later, Tommie Bear, basically left with little human interaction or positive behavioral reinforcement, finishes up as a tragic and depressed pup \u2013 knowing that when again he\u2019s at the shelter with loud noises, strange people and an unknown future.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5323\" src=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/toggle-5-561x411-1-300x225-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201c\u2026 The adopter says he gets very over protective on the person-owner and he might not be good around kids. Dogs always need direction and leadership, especially in this breed. Just check out him during this video, complete in shock, depressed and no idea what he did wrong\u2026makes me sad, angry and that\u2019s why I feel he needs this point a rescue to manage his adoption, because adopters don\u2019t have with experience and Tommie doesn\u2019t need to be ended again this manner ,\u201d a volunteer at the shelter wrote.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5324\" src=\"https:\/\/techtimes.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Tommy-Bear-adopted-197x300-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"197\" height=\"300\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Succeeding are shelter notes from Tommie Bear\u2019s bad luck: LAST UPDATE 10\/22: BEAR ALIAS TOMMIE KS BACK RETURNED AFTER BEEN ADOPTED FEW MONTHS AGO!
