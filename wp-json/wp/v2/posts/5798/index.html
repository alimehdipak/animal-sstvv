That\u2019s why you see them all explode with emotions after their owners return to them after a long period of time. They feel loved, but they don\u2019t understand how to contain their happiness, so they just decide to let it all out and that\u2019s why you see them get the most random zoomies, that\u2019s because they really don\u2019t understand how to react. That\u2019s what love does to you and I am happy about it.<\/p>\n<p>Something similar happened in the story that we have got for you guys today. It\u2019s a story about a cat who could sense someone close is returning after a very long time. And it sensed right. This moment of a soldier dad returning from duty to meet his cat caught the eye of a lot of viewers and it is safe to say, everyone cried with tears of happiness trickling down their faces.<\/p>\n<h2>The Ragdoll kitty, Finners, had his heart in his mouth as soon as the day began. He already had a feeling that something huge was going to happen.

They can differentiate people very well through their scent even if you blindfold them. Even though Nick had been away for a very long time and his military gear smelled nothing like home, it still felt like Finners could smell his scent from far away.<\/p>\n<h2>Finners\u2019 curiosity kept rising as now he was literally hanging by the doorknob as if he could smell his Dad is just seconds away from him.<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-214258 lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/defused.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Cat-hold-door.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/defused.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Cat-hold-door.png 593w, https:\/\/defused.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Cat-hold-door-204x300.png 204w\" alt=\"\" width=\"593\" height=\"873\" data-expand=\"600\" data-src=\"https:\/\/defused.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Cat-hold-door.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/defused.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Cat-hold-door.png 593w, https:\/\/defused.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Cat-hold-door-204x300.png 204w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px\" data-essbisindex=\"4\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"code-block code-block-2 code-block-block-2\">\n<div>Advertisement<\/div>\n<div id=\"div-2\" data-google-query-id=\"CK3z6sCz6vwCFWikUQodpwgDEw\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Via\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Cx14ohE6nHs&amp;t=93s\">YouTube<\/a><\/p>\n<p>And the big moment came.

The video ended up going viral and is currently sitting at a whopping 32,000,000 views. It is safe to say that a sea of people cried that day.<\/p>\n<p>I really hope you guys enjoyed this gorgeous moment that took place between Nick and Finners. I absolutely love when pets get reunited with those who they dearly love. It is not easy for them to deal with the separation and it often causes them anxiety. In fact, separation is one of the major causes of anxiety in pets. But Finners is a strong boy, he didn\u2019t need any anxiety jackets or vet visits. He knew his daddy would return home and you can tell he couldn\u2019t wait for this beautiful moment to take place.<br \/>\nPlease do share your precious thoughts in the comments section down below.<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Cx14ohE6nHs\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more cat moments!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-214261 lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/defused.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Cute-cat-rescued.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/defused.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Cute-cat-rescued.jpg 700w, https:\/\/defused.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Cute-cat-rescued-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/defused.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Cute-cat-rescued-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/defused.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Cute-cat-rescued-100x100.jpg 100w, https:\/\/defused.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Cute-cat-rescued-600x600.jpg 600w\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"700\" data-expand=\"600\" data-src=\"https:\/\/defused.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Cute-cat-rescued.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/defused.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Cute-cat-rescued.jpg 700w, https:\/\/defused.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Cute-cat-rescued-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/defused.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Cute-cat-rescued-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/defused.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Cute-cat-rescued-100x100.jpg 100w, https:\/\/defused.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Cute-cat-rescued-600x600.jpg 600w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"code-block code-block-5 code-block-block-5\">\n<div>Advertisement<\/div>\n<div id=\"div-5\" data-google-query-id=\"CLDz6sCz6vwCFWikUQodpwgDEw\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Via\u00a0<a class=\"open-list-submission-source\" href=\"https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/BeforeNAfterAdoption\/comments\/sdn84u\/one_of_my_saddest_beginning_rescue_cases_this\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hoperosaliex<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Cat tax.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne of my saddest beginning rescue cases.
