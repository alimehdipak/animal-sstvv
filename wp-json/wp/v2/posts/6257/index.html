She was incredibly skinny with all her rib bones clearly visible. When Southern Indiana Animal Rescue came to select her up, they found that she was only 70 pounds when she should\u2019ve been about 140. However, the rescue later learned that her weight wasn\u2019t even her worst problem. Poor Mae was diagnosed with terminal cancer, given between 2 weeks, and a couple of months to somemeasure.<\/p>\n<p>The rescuers knew that May should spend her last days comfortably. Therefore, Elizabeth Starck (Elizabeth Starck) continued to raise her. Over the past 9 years, Starck has fostered about 400 animals. She\u2019s always determined to offer them the simplest life possible.<\/p>\n<div class=\"code-block code-block-3\">\n<div id=\"M822805ScriptRootC1344714_01622\">\n<div id=\"MarketGidComposite1344714_01622\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-2775\" src=\"https:\/\/lololovepets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/jada-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>\u201cI love the old ones.

It changes their life hopefully.\u201d Caring for Mae, For such an outsized dog, Mae isn\u2019t cheap, especially when it involves food. She eats about 10 cans of food a day! So, the rescue posted on Facebook posing for food donations, and to their surprise, many of us were extremely generous.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-2776\" src=\"https:\/\/lololovepets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Mae-2-e1578413271108.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>About 800 cans of pet food were donated to the rescue. Anearly all those donations came from locations farther away like Texas, California, and even Hawaii! These amazing donations not only gave Mae enough food, but also helped many other dogs in need.also. Mae soon became very fashionable on social media. Rescuers and Stark regularly post cute photos and updates on Mae. She has many people cheering her on. She has attended some fundraisers and meet-and-greets with fans. This sweet dog gets along side all her fellow foster dogs and foster cats. She\u2019s very curious around the cats and likes to follow them around.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-2777\" src=\"https:\/\/lololovepets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Mae-4-e1578413572281.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>A Formal Adoption Starck quickly learned that she and Mae had a especial bond. Mae is such a sweet and loving dog, and Starck knew that Mae was meant to be a neighborhood of her family.

She lives for food and her newly discovered cat friend. She had such a mild way about her and her calm way showed whenever she met someone new. I\u2019m getting to miss her adorable face such a lot and I\u2019d roll in the hay everywhere again if I could.
