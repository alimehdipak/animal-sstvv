<p>Last week, the 620 First Bus in West Yorkshire picked up a lonely traveller. An abandoned Staffie-mix boarded the bus in Bierely and then sat all alone, breaking everyone’s hearts.</p>
<p>She sat quietly in her seat and looked around with sad eyes while she sniffed the air as if looking for someone who wasn’t there.</p>
<p>Her fellow passengers looked after the forlorn little vagabond until the bus reached its final stop and the staff could take her off the bus.</p>
<p>She was then taken to Cliffe Kennels where she was nicknamed Olive and looked after while waiting for her owner to appear.<br />
However, days passed without anyone coming forward to claim her; it looked like she was truly alone in the world.</p>
<p>But Olive’s luck was about to turn. Gemma Burton, who’d ridden the bus with Olive, had snapped a picture of the doleful pup and shared it on social media in the hope of reuniting Olive with her owner.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3929" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/heartbroken-dog-seen-riding-a-bus-alone-finds-forever-home-after-her-photo-goes-viral-01-e1572004942111-262x300-1.jpg" alt="" width="262" height="300" /></p>
<p>Gemma’s post quickly went viral; it was shared thousands of times on Facebook and the story was picked up by various news sites. People from all over the world were sending their love and hoping to give Olive her happy ending.</p>
<p>Now it seems like that happy ending has come. While Olive’s original owner hasn’t come forward, several people have reached out and expressed their wishes to open not only their hearts but their homes to Olive.</p>
<p>Denise Ball, the owner of Cliff Kennels, says that Olive will go to her new home very soon.</p>
<p>Olive’s happy ending might also mean a new start for several other lonely pups. While only one family can adopt Olive, there are many other dogs currently looking for a forever home. Denise hopes that the people who miss out on adopting Olive will consider visiting Yorkshires rescue centres and give another dog a loving home.</p>
<p>Olive’s lonely days are almost over and we are sure that she’ll be very happy in her new forever home.</p>

<p>You’ve probably seen a lot of emergency services for people, but you’ve probably never seen an animal being rescued, and this man also couldn’t believe he gave CPR to an elephant.<br />
<strong>That is so wonderful to know and so pleased that baby Ellie was saved. Thank you so much for what you did!</strong></p>
<p>A motorbike [stru.ck] a baby elephant as it crossed a road with a herd of wild elephants in Chanthaburi province, eastern Thailand. Mana Srivate, a local lifeguard, rushed to the scene as soon as people called for assistance.</p>
<p>He is perplexed that his first aid subject is an elephant; in his 26-year career, he has performed dozens of CPR, but never on an elephant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3">
<div id="M822805ScriptRootC1344714_0a4fd">
<div id="MarketGidComposite1344714_0a4fd"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3906" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_23-300x225-2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was, however, professional and quick to tre.at the strangest pa.tient he had ever encountered. It was instinct, but I was nervous the whole time because I could hear the mother and other elephants calling her baby.</p>
<p>Srivate attempted to give the po.or creature a heart massage while colleagues a few meters away tre.ated the motorcyclist and were left stu.nned. Srivate doesn’t even know where the elephant’s heart is, so he relies on human theory and a video clip he saw online to save the baby elephant.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3909" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_29-1-300x225-2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>Not only that, but rescuers are under even more pressure because the rest of the elephants are not far away and could arrive at any time. The baby elephant miraculously revived after a dra.matic ten-minute period. Fortunately, the motorcyclist was not se.rio.usly hu.rt.</p>
<p>Srivate almost cri.ed when the baby elephant began to move. That is truly amazing!<br />
After 10 minutes, the elephant slowly stood up and was loaded onto a truck and transported to another location for tre.atment before being returned to the original location to be reunited with its herd.</p>

<p>This was the first time Mana provided first aid to an elephant, and he was overjoyed when the baby elephant was saved. Many people have admired his quick wits; we can’t imagine the disaster if Mana does not arrive on time.</p>
<p><strong>God bless Mana and the baby elephant!</strong></p>

<p>So happy this baby is alive. Good on you for doing that, very kind hearted person you are well done! Thank you for saving that sweet baby.<br />

<p dir="ltr"> A dog that had been missing for two months was rescued by a team of speleologists. Due to the layout of the building, their objective was especially challenging, as reported by positive-info.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Almost two months after disappearing on June 9, a dog named Abby was discovered and saved by cave divers on August 6.</p>

<p dir="ltr">When hunting for Abby, how did her family not notice that she had wandered off and ended up in a cave? Only she can provide a definitive response to this inquiry. Even though she had access to water and freshwater fish and crustaceans, it is unknown how she survived in this unfriendly and entirely dark habitat.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3861" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3-80-238x300-1.png" alt="" width="238" height="300" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">However, experts immediately went into action to save the puppy after learning that she had been seen in the Tom Moore subterranean tunnels between Brewer and Perryville in Missouri. The crew of cavers included Rick Haley and Gerry Keene. They went straight into the 35 km long maze. They eventually tracked down the animal, but freeing it was no easy task.</p>
</div>
<div class="HTML">
<p dir="ltr">They squished Abby into a 60-centimeter opening, then climbed the rock face 150 meters upward to the surface.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3862" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/5-51-231x300-1.png" alt="" width="231" height="300" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Robert Cahoon, deputy chief of the Biehle fire brigade, helped them outside. Between the two of them, they canvassed the area looking for the dog’s owners. Once they found the correct address, they were able to enter. Abby’s owners, who had given up hope that they would ever see their dog alive again after so much time had passed since she had vanished, were shocked. Back at home, the dog is taking it easy as she recovers from her ordeal.</p>

<h1><strong>Elephants are very loving, family oriented, compassionate animals who feel deeply!</strong></h1>
<p><strong>They are so family oriented taking care of the little one who lo.st his Mother.</strong><br />
HOW PRECIOUS!! ANIMALS have more COMPASSION than most HUMANS! <img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f495.svg" alt="&#x1f495;" /><img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f495.svg" alt="&#x1f495;" /><img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f4a4.svg" alt="&#x1f4a4;" /><img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f418.svg" alt="&#x1f418;" /><img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f418.svg" alt="&#x1f418;" /><img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f418.svg" alt="&#x1f418;" /></p>
<p>Many people’s hearts were br.o.ken when the orp.haned baby elephants shared their gri.ef and comforted another baby elephant who has just [lo.st] his mother.<br />
The emotional moment occurred in 2018, when a crew from the “David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT)”, an elephant orp.hanage, was in the area on a routine patrol when they noticed the stranger sign. A young’s lone tracks in the sand along the Tiva River.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3">
<div id="M822805ScriptRootC1344714_08bca">
<div id="MarketGidComposite1344714_08bca"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3815" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_1-6-300x225-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They quickly discovered an [exh.aus.ted] baby elephant cr.ying for its mother. Unfortunately, his mother di.ed a long time ago, and he was rescued by these good people.</p>
<p>The orp.haned Mukkoka is a one-year-old elephant who was me.dically checked, properly fed with the orp.hanage’s miracle milk formula, and miraculously recovered within a few days.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3816" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_2-5-300x225-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>However, for an orp.haned elephant, life was nothing but difficult, so the volunteers decided to introduce Mukkoka to the new family. And the other elephants surrounded him with care and concern as soon as he met his new herd as if they could sense his sa.dness.</p>
<p>They enveloped him and led him out into the woods to meet the other of the herd. The other infants gave him a warm welcome, extending out their trunks to reassure and accept Mukkoka as a new member of the family.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3814" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/thumb-41-300x163.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="163" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/thumb-41-300x163.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/thumb-41.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>This image shows once again these creatures are special beyond human imagination. They have a great deal of compassion and empathy for others.</p>
<p>Mukkoka will most likely spend the next ten years in the care of the DSWT before being released back into the wild. Until then, he’ll heal and learn how to be an elephant, with help from his loving foster family every step of the way.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3812" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_4-3-300x225-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>The baby elephant is now a member of a new family, and it will never be left behind, that’s for sure!</p>
<p>So sorry about the baby who lo.st his mom <img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f972.svg" alt="&#x1f972;" /> but grateful for the other Elephants who gave him so much love<img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/2764.svg" alt="&#x2764;" /><img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f499.svg" alt="&#x1f499;" /><br />
The human race could and should learn what Empathy is from what these wonderful Noble Animals are !!</p>

<p>They are the most beautiful animals inside and out.<br />

<p>This is the tale of an orphaned polar bear who was rescued from the verge of fatality by gold miners in the Arctic.</p>
<p>The cub was entrusted to fend for herself after her mommy passed away while on a remote Russian island, this triggered her to come close to the gold mine and beg to be fed.</p>

<p>In spite of their being policies prohibiting the feeding of polar bears, the miners decided that saving her life was more crucial.</p>
<p>Therefore, they all cared for her throughout several months, unfortunately, though, this implied she became tamed like a dog.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3801" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2-345-1-164x300.jpeg" alt="" width="164" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2-345-1-164x300.jpeg 164w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2-345-1.jpeg 306w" sizes="(max-width: 164px) 100vw, 164px" /></figure>
<p>As she no relied on the miners for her food, the polar bear cub lost the capacity to hunt for itself.</p>
<p>In the footage below, you can see the cub climbing up a ladder prior to jumping to adoringly hug among the miners.</p>

<p>” The women cub invested numerous months living near to humans, as well as obtained so used to them that it behaved like a canine,” stated a neighborhood record.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the gold miners’ contract finished as well as they returned back to the mainland, but not before making certain the polar bear cub was looked after.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3802" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3-314-1-278x300.jpeg" alt="" width="278" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3-314-1-278x300.jpeg 278w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3-314-1.jpeg 634w" sizes="(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px" /></figure>
<p>Andrey Gorban, 56, supervisor of Royev Ruchei Zoo in Krasnoyarsk, who supervised of the rescue said: “The workers could just connect with us at the end of their work stint, as they had no communication web link at the base.”</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3803" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/4-282-1-277x300.jpeg" alt="" width="277" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/4-282-1-277x300.jpeg 277w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/4-282-1.jpeg 634w" sizes="(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px" /></figure>
<p>“We were informed that the men were leaving back to the landmass, and also the cub had stayed there alone.”</p>
<p>” Our only hope was that they left rather a large open rubbish site, so there was a possibility that the cub could feed off it for weeks.”</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3804" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/5-230-1-226x300.jpeg" alt="" width="226" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/5-230-1-226x300.jpeg 226w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/5-230-1.jpeg 634w" sizes="(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px" /></figure>
<p>With help from the Moscow Zoo, a mission was released to save the tame bear by taking it to the Moscow Zoo.</p>
<p>The bear was discovered on the miners’ website plainly pining for its missing pals and was required to the Zoo where a decision will certainly be made on where to residence it.</p>

<p>The bear can not return to the wild as she is too reliant on human beings and would certainly not survive on her own.</p>
<p>In spite of breaking the regulations pertaining to feeding the polar bear, Andrey Gorban applauded the miners for conserving the shed as well as helpless cub.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3806" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/7-153-1-278x300.jpeg" alt="" width="278" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/7-153-1-278x300.jpeg 278w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/7-153-1.jpeg 634w" sizes="(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px" /></figure>

<p><strong>Your dog really missed you. That’s Unconditional love. Such a special love.

<p>Buddy is a 13-year-old Golden Retriever who spent her entire life with her best friend Hannah Foraker. And Hannah enlisted in the army and went to basic training in Oklahoma when she turned 21.</p>
<p>When Hannah returned home for Christmas after three months away at basic training, she couldn’t wait to see Buddy. Buddy couldn’t contain her joy and excitement when she saw Hannah again. She buries her head in Hannah’s lap and begins to cry in joy the moment she sees her after three months apart. Of course, Hannah was moved and began to pet her beloved friend.</p>
<p><strong>It’s photos like this that bring tears to your eyes…!</strong></p>

<p>Buddy is very old now, art.hritis, and mostly de.af, but nothing stopped her from receiving Hannah with the best welcome. Foraker said: We opened the front door and she came running out and greeted me and my family, but then kind of did a double-take and came back to me.</p>
<p>The dog is the most devoted of all animals. They never forget those they love and give them “Unconditional Love”. This is true love of a dog and his best friend reunite together thats a is a great welcome home for them both. So it just proves that animals have got feelings too</p>

<h1><strong>So wonderful how the elephant knew the dan.ger of his caretaker!</strong></h1>
<p>How cud anyone not love Elephants? They r highly intelligent, loving, kind, affectionate, loyal to those who treat them kindly, emotional &amp; absolutely adorable &amp; superb!<br />
They feel love, gr.ief, fe.ar, sa.dness, joy, &amp; all the emotions humans feel! <img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/2764.svg" alt="&#x2764;" /><img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/2764.svg" alt="&#x2764;" /><img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f418.svg" alt="&#x1f418;" /><img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f418.svg" alt="&#x1f418;" /><img decoding="async" class="emoji" role="img" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f418.svg" alt="&#x1f418;" /></p>
<p>This story shows us a different side of elephants; a giant elephant can seem to be very slow., but their love for their caretaker is very strong, and they may even put themselves in dan.ger for the sake of their beloved one.</p>
<p>Derrick, an employee of a nature park in Thailand, is taking some elephants for a walk along the river, as usual in the hot summer months.<br />
However, while Derrick was swimming in the water and appeared to be swept away by the current, an unexpected scene occurred.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without hesitation, an elephant approached him and drew him back; the elephant appeared hurried and concerned that he would be in dan.ger.<br />
The man was fine, and the water wasn’t too deep, but the brave elephant’s determination caused him to cry!</p>
<p>The elephant ran as fast as he could to come over and assist him with his trunk so he could cling and escape. The man was not in any dan.ger, but he didn’t refuse the elephant’s bravery and kindness; he clung to the trunk and kept saying thank you to the elephant, it’s truly adorable!</p>

<p>This cute elephant con.fusion has won the hearts of many! Everyone praised the elephant’s wisdom, bravery, and gratitude. He would have saved a life if it had been in a really dan.ger.ous situation.</p>
<p>That shows the love that she has for her caretaker he had to be good to her she would not love him as much and elephants just love wholeheartedly we don’t give them enough credit!</p>

<p>St. Bernards are arguably various the foremost lovely canine on this planet, however folks don’t discriminate when it includes dumping their pets on the shelter. The trio of Saint Bernard brothers, named Gunther, Goliath, and Gasket had been heartlessly left on the Edmonton Humane Society, and it immediately turned obvious that the brothers would not be able to be separated.
