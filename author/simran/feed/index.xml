<p>A wildlife photographer has shared a once-in-a-lifetime photo of what he believes is a “never before seen” yellow penguin.</p>
<p>Yves Adams, who’s a Belgian landscape and wildlife photographer spotted the wonderfully unique king penguin sporting a bright yellow plumage – as opposed to the usual black feathers</p>

<p>All while leading a two-month photography expedition throughout Antarctica and the South Atlantic.</p>
<p>The group made a stop on an island in South Georgia to photograph a colony of over 120,000 king penguins.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4992" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/39488588-9278253-image-a-74_1613738192842-1-300x200.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/39488588-9278253-image-a-74_1613738192842-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/39488588-9278253-image-a-74_1613738192842-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/39488588-9278253-image-a-74_1613738192842-1.jpeg 962w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure>
<p>Adams noticed the unusual sight when unloading some safety equipment and food onto Salisbury Plain, which he had never before seen. a penguin with such bright yellow plumage.</p>
<p>“I’d never seen or heard of a yellow penguin before. There were 120,000 birds on that beach and this was the only yellow one there.”</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4989" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/39488580-9278253-image-a-79_1613738219757-300x179.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="179" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/39488580-9278253-image-a-79_1613738219757-300x179.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/39488580-9278253-image-a-79_1613738219757-768x458.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/39488580-9278253-image-a-79_1613738219757.jpeg 962w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure>
<p>Luckily for the photographers, the almost tropical-looking penguin had landed on the beach close by to the group. So they got an amazing view of it unobstructed by the sea of penguins and seals in the area.</p>
<p>“We were so lucky the bird landed right where we were,” the photographer says. “Our view wasn’t blocked by a sea of massive animals. Normally it’s almost impossible to move on this beach because of them all.”</p>
<p>“It was heaven that he landed by us. If it had been 50 meters away we wouldn’t have been able to get this show of a lifetime.”</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4989" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/39488580-9278253-image-a-79_1613738219757-300x179.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="179" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/39488580-9278253-image-a-79_1613738219757-300x179.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/39488580-9278253-image-a-79_1613738219757-768x458.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/39488580-9278253-image-a-79_1613738219757.jpeg 962w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure>
<p>The penguin’s unusual yellow plumage is due to leucism, which results in a loss of pigmentation. It’s similar to albinism but the animal keeps some of its pigments.</p>
<p>“This is a leucistic penguin,” Adams says. “Its cells don’t create melanin anymore so its black feathers become this yellow and creamy color.”</p>
<p>Scientists have found that the yellow pigment in penguin feathers is chemically distinct from all other molecules that are known to give color to feathers.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2676" src="https://lololovecats.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/39488584-9278253-image-a-77_1613738208489.jpeg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>“Penguins use the yellow pigment to attract mates and we strongly suspect that the yellow molecule is synthesized internally,” researcher Daniel Thomas tells <em>Smithsonian Insider</em>.</p>
<p>“[It’s] distinct from any of the five known classes of avian plumage pigmentation and represents a new sixth class of feather pigment. As far as we are aware, the molecule is unlike any of the yellow pigments found in a penguin’s diet.”</p>
<p>In this particular case, it’s not clear whether the yellow color of the penguin is attractive or repulsive for the opposite sex.</p>

<p>People dedicate their whole lives to saving animals, just out of love, and this is what Kevin Richardson does.</p>
<p>One day, while working at the Lion Park in South Africa, he witnessed a mother lion reject two of her newborn cubs. Some people may have feared approaching the pair, but Kevin’s instincts told him otherwise.</p>
<p>Rather than letting them get taken and put in cages, he placed the cubs into a wildlife park, where they could flourish.</p>

<p>It had been a long time since they had seen each other, and he was unsure if they would remember him.</p>
<p>Kevin decided to approach the lions without hesitation, and thankfully for us, he recorded the encounter with a GoPro.<img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4986" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/794652_s_1622886855447-1-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/794652_s_1622886855447-1-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/794652_s_1622886855447-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/794652_s_1622886855447-1-768x432.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/794652_s_1622886855447-1-1280x720.jpg 1280w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/794652_s_1622886855447-1.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>
<p>“She looks at me, I look at her, and we know. That’s trust.”</p>
<p>What happened next was truly incredible, as soon as she realized who Kevin was, she jumped straight into the water and embraced Kevin with a hug.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4984" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/c44-234x300.jpeg" alt="" width="234" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/c44-234x300.jpeg 234w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/c44-768x984.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/c44.jpeg 799w" sizes="(max-width: 234px) 100vw, 234px" /></figure>
<p>Kevin describes them as his ‘soul mates,’ they will always have this special bond no matter how long they are apart.</p>
<p>He also went on to explain how the cubs learnt to trust him so much, as they spent time together:</p>
<p>“To see the lions doing what lions do for me was exhilarating. It made me realise there was a different way to work with these predators in captivity. Meg and Amy and me have a history that goes to when they were born.”</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://ilovemydogsomuch.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/17504656_10155275278087249_1125928824462564595_o-945x630.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>Kevin felt that Meg and Amy were “destined for a bullet” by trophy hunters and said he “firmly believe that if I never had m and a back they would have landed up in some shape or form in the canned lion hunting market.”</p>
<p>Kevin, also known as the ‘lion whisper,’ also founded the “<em>Kevin Richardson Wildlife Sanctuary</em>,” which is a 3,000 lion shelter in the African savanna. He shelters 26 lions of different ages, many like Meg and Amy, who he had known from cubs.</p>

<p>These <strong>elegant deer</strong> have long been prized as <strong>ornamental species,</strong> and it’s not hard to see why!</p>
<p>From their <strong>shiny, stylish coats of fur</strong> to their <strong>majestic antlers,</strong> these beautiful creatures can be found in many places around the world.</p>
<p>Fallow deer are <strong>native to parts of Europe</strong>; it was only in the last two millennia that these deer have been distributed around the world, now they can be <strong>found in places such as the USA and South Africa.</strong> https://youtu.be/p89izjxIbNM</p>
<p>Fallow deer have four main variations of coat:</p>
<p><strong>Common</strong> – Tan with white spots and a white patch outlined with black horseshoe-shaped border, this coat fades to a general grey colour during the winter.</p>

<p>Mitchell Miner, 15, and his cow Audri participated in the Lowe State Cauldron Fair.<br />
Unfortunately, they didn’t manage to win a notable place, but that didn’t discourage them. This day was so exhausting that the boy fell asleep, with his favourite cow Audrey! This caring cow did something that is not very typical for an animal. She hugged the tired boy as if to comfort him for a bad result. They were fifth out of a total of seven participants. When the boy’s father entered the barn to look for his son, he found this touching scene.</p>
<p>He looked sad, but also full of love. He immediately took a camera to capture the moment.<br />
When he posted the video online, the comments were more than good, and the father wrote:<br />
“Our son Mitchell and his heifer after yesterday’s show”. The video immediately went viral and received more than 15,000 likes by the next day.<br />
The boy’s parents were thrilled by this unusual connection between a man and a cow. They have always tried to teach their children about life in the countryside. They believed that a good person consists of love and care for animals.</p>

&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We learned a lot on the farm,” says Jeremy Miner, Mitchell’s father. “We have those values in us and we try to do everything we can to keep them.”</p>
<div>
<p>It is certain that the boy will not give up, maybe he will have better luck next time.</p>
<p>Watch a video about this unusual moment:</p>

<p>We are used to beautiful videos about domestic cats that make us laugh to tears or are tender and awaken beautiful feelings in us. We also like to watch videos about dogs and other animals, but wild animals can also be totally cute and create a moment that some people can capture on camera and share with the whole world. The video that is making a splash on the internet shows us the moment when the lion dad sees his cub for the first time.<br />
The lion they named Tobias is not a typical father lion who is not very interested in his cub, he is the complete opposite! I’m sure that’s why he has captured many hearts and left many viewers pondering and admiring how a large and ferocious animal holds so much tenderness.</p>
<p>The Denver Zoo is responsible for this wonderful shot. The moment when the lion dad greets his cub shocked many.<br />
Everyone present was interested in this moment when the big lion father leans down to his son and shows him affection and love in this way. Everyone was thrilled by this action, which they honestly did not expect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3">

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adult lions generally treat their cubs differently, they can be aggressive or disinterested towards them. They devote themselves to sleeping and eating and leave the care of the cubs to the lionesses.<br />
This viral video is truly a rarity, and the zoo staff wanted to see this moment and share it with the world.</p>
<div class="google-auto-placed ap_container">
<p>From that day on, dad Leo and his cub spend a lot of time together. Together with mum Neliah and another sister, they form a wonderful family full of love and tenderness.</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4911" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/5uztut-300x196-1.png" alt="" width="300" height="196" /></div>
<div>
<p>The Denver Zoo recently announced:</p>
<p>“Half of Africa’s lions have disappeared in the last 25 years, and the species is increasingly threatened by poaching, loss of prey and habitat destruction. The birth of a cub is a huge success for the Lion Species Survival Plan (LAP), which ensures healthy, genetically diverse lion populations at Zoo and Aquarium Association (AZA) facilities.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4909" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/utziz-300x169-1.png" alt="" width="300" height="169" /></p>
<p>We hope that people who see our little lion cub will be inspired and take action to protect its wild conspecifics and other wildlife around the world. “</p>
<p>Watch the video and see for yourself the magical moment we are talking about:</p>

<p>The charm of nature is infinite; it continues to amaze us. And also if we are lucky enough, we can locate extraordinary instances of wonderful charm anywhere at any moment.</p>
<p>It may be around our city, around our community, or perhaps around our house. All we need to do is remain in touch with nature and also breath according to the pace of it. And we will discover the elegance of nature pertaining to us.</p>
<p>A Texan family was lucky sufficient to catch these charming pictures of a child lizard oversleeping a rose. They inadvertently stumbled upon this miraculous minute.</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-15">
<p>The couple’s daughter brought her mom a rose. When the mom took a close consider the appealing increased she located a child reptile asleep inside the rose. It looks like something straight out of a fairy tale or a Disney motion picture.</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-9">
<p>They showed to be incredibly popular on Imgur, winning tons of hearts.</p>
<p>It is secure to say that the pictures made everybody go aww. The woman herself is amazed at exactly how rare shots like these are, claiming that she will probably never see anything similar to this for the remainder of her life.</p>
<p>Picture Credit History: Cmycherrytree.</p>
<p># 1. How charming is this? Would certainly you check out this cute infant lizard resting so quietly inside this rose? As well as oh my god that rose! I love that shade; those climbed flowers appear like they are constructed of soft satin!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4891" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/31-6-300x225-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3">
<div id="M822805ScriptRootC1344714"></div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p># 2. It is fantastic exactly how the child lizard fits completely in the rose! It needs to be rather little to fit inside the rose flowers! And it should be rather comfy sleeping on a bed of smooth increased petals. Don’t you simply desire you had a bed made of rose flowers?</p>
<p>I am sure sleeping on such a bed would certainly do ask yourself to the skin!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4891" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/31-6-300x225-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p># 3. Is it just me or does it resemble the infant reptile as well as the rose are made for each other? They actually do praise each other!</p>
<p>So, did you like the pictures? We hope you will certainly have the good luck of coming across such an adorable point yourself!</p>

<p>Chinchillas are crepuscular rodents that belong to the family of chinchillidae. These creatures are comparatively larger and robust than ground squirrels. They originated from the Andes mountains in South America. Chinchillas are found living in colonies called herds.</p>
<p>These animals are known to have the densest fur among all the mammals living on land. The name “chinchilla” was derived from the Chincha people who lived in the Andes. Towards the end of the 19th century, these animals became rare due to being hunted for their soft and valuable fur. Farm-raised chinchillas are used in producing clothing and other accessories.</p>
<p>Cameron Holmes from Cameron’s Chinchillas in the United Kingdom shared these pictures of adorable chinchillas with perfectly round buttocks. These animals are being taken well care of and their coats look naturally gorgeous. The fur assists them in surviving harsh climates.</p>
<p>They take dust baths in the morning to clean themselves. Chinchillas simply adore having snacks and taking naps. “We turn the lights and say good morning to all of the chinchillas and each of them is waiting by their food hopper waiting for it to be filled up,” expressed Cameron.</p>

<p>Elephants are not and have never wanted to be kept as pets; they cannot be happy in cap.tiv.ity; their true home is in the deep green jungle. It’s a great pity that no one cares whether they’re happy or not. What people do is fully exploit their worth, even a.bu.sing and tor.turing po.or elephants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3">

<p>Sook Jai is a 73-year-old elephant who has spent most of her life in cap.tiv.ity and has been [bru.tally tre.at.ed]. was so.ld to various owners and forced to do a variety of jobs ranging from tourist trekking to street begging. This had a [ser.io.us im.pact on her he.alth], causing her to [lo.se] her sight and most of her hearing.</p>
<p>She was a.bu.sed both physically and mentally for decades and has never dreamed of living freely and not being [for.c.ed] to work!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4795" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_13-1-300x225-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>Fortunately, Elephant Nature Park, an elephant rehabilitation and rehabilitation center in Northern Thailand, came to pick up Sook Jai and give her a new home at their sanctuary. The elephant was 73 years old and in poor health when she arrived. The rescuers were moved to tears by the [wo.un.ds] on her head and body; they felt compelled to give her the best care possible.</p>

<p>On the journey to Elephant Nature Park, the team warmed the truck when it was cold and cooled the elephants when it was hot, Sook Jai wasn’t used to being treated so well. Despite the rescue team’s best efforts, she still showed signs of fatigue and refused to eat, but when Sook Jai sensed something from the rescuers, she burst into tears. Everyone’s heart was moved by this beautiful moment.</p>

<p>The following days, Sook Jai can live a more comfortable, peaceful life in the reserve for the rest of his life. She is deserving of such a life!</p>

<p>Every mother’s instinct is to protect her children, whether human or animal and what this cat did in New South Wales, Australia, is an excellent example of what a mother can do to save her creatures.<br />
A passerby noticed a family of cats by the side of the road, consisting of a mother and her three kittens.</p>
<p>He immediately contacted CatRescue 901, a Terrey Hills-based rescue organization. When the rescuers came, the cat approached them and brought them to her three babies. She was skin and bones, and she had plainly done everything she could to feed and protect her animals.</p>
<p>The four cats needed medical care, and when they arrived at the shelter, it was obvious they were starving. Upon assessing their condition, the vets realized that the three kittens had eyelid agenesis, a congenital condition that caused them to have no eyelids, and would have led them to blindness if they didn’t receive proper treatment.</p>
<p>They were fed and bathed, and allowed to rest on comfortable beds. Medication was also administered and the feline mom, Elodie, was faring better, especially after being spayed.</p>
<p>Jenny, the founder of the rescue group, stated that they were in the right location at the right moment. “Not many people could afford eye agenesis surgery since it’s so costly,” she explained. The path to recovery is still ahead of them, but what matters is that their mother, Elodie, is certain that they are in excellent hands.</p>
<p><strong>This is Elodie, a feline mom who tried her best to keep her kittens fed and safe, but was clearly struggling to go on.</strong></p>
